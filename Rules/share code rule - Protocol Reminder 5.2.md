# PROTOCOL REMINDER

Please ensure strict adherence to the ULTIMATE CODE SHARING PROTOCOL (UCSP) as defined in documents 5 and 5.1:

## Key Requirements:
- Provide clear tracking: `PART [N]/~[TOTAL] COMPLETE (APPROXIMATELY [X]% OF TOTAL)`
- Wait for explicit "continue" command before proceeding
- Begin next part with last 10 lines from previous part
- Include proper continuation marker: `CONTINUATION FROM PART [N-1]`
- Verify content integrity before submission

## For Your Next Response:
1. Acknowledge this reminder
2. Confirm current part number and progress percentage
3. Include proper continuation marker with the last 10 lines
4. Maintain consistent format throughout all parts
5. End with: `PART [N] MAXIMUM CAPACITY CONFIRMED - WAITING FOR CONTINUE COMMAND`

Following this protocol consistently ensures complete and accurate code transfer.
