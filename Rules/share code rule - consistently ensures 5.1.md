You're absolutely right - the rules are well-designed but I didn't follow them consistently. Let me suggest some improvements to ensure better adherence to the protocol:

1. **Rule Initialization Checklist**: Before starting any file sharing, I should create a checklist from the protocol rules and explicitly check off each requirement as I go. This would ensure I don't skip steps later in the process.

2. **Standardized Templates**: I should use consistent templated responses for each part:
   ```
   ATTEMPTING FULL CONTENT INSERTION
   CAPACITY LIMIT REACHED AT APPROXIMATELY [X] CHARACTERS - SPLITTING REQUIRED
   PROGRESS: PART [N]/~[TOTAL] COMPLETE (APPROXIMATELY [X]% OF TOTAL)
   PART [N] MAXIMUM CAPACITY CONFIRMED - WAITING FOR CONTINUE COMMAND
   ```

3. **State Tracking**: I should maintain explicit awareness of which part I'm currently working on and what steps I've completed to avoid premature advancement.

4. **Self-Validation Steps**: Before concluding each part, I should verify I've met all protocol requirements by running through a validation checklist.

5. **Enhanced Wait States**: I should implement clearer boundaries when waiting for user confirmation - not providing any additional information or creating any new artifacts until explicitly commanded to continue.

6. **Error Recovery Protocol**: If I notice an error in protocol adherence, I should immediately acknowledge it, explain the error, and resume from the last correct point following the recovery protocol in rule #12.

The key issue was that I began strongly but became less disciplined with the protocol as we progressed. With these improvements, I should be able to maintain consistent adherence from beginning to end in future file sharing tasks.

Would you like me to create a simplified version of the protocol that highlights these key procedural steps to make it easier to follow consistently?
