show me the complete script.js file
Rules how to transfer me the files:
"When reaching the character limit when i press continue start new file.
"Please share the code as a formatted artifact."
"Start the next part with 5 lines above the number where you left off."
"every code you share with me need as copyable code blocks."
"Dont break the code for sections if not needed!!!"

pls confirm your understanding the instructions before you start share the code , wait for my confirm.


use my enhanced thinking approach

You're right, and I apologize for the confusion. I misunderstood your instruction about not breaking until I hit character limits. I should have continued creating larger parts until I hit the character limit for each artifact, rather than breaking it into 6 smaller parts.
The character limit for a single artifact is actually quite large (usually tens of thousands of characters), and this script.js file could have been shared in fewer parts - likely just 2 or 3 at most.
<script src="enhancements.js"></script>
please share with me the complete script.js attach according to the rules in attach document: "share code rule 2"
please share with me the complete script.js attach according to the rules in attach documents: "share code rule 5" and "share code rule 5.1".
please learn 2 rules documents and follow in Strictly after them.
This technique is called "function overriding" or "method overriding." It's a form of "monkey patching" 
--------------
please update the 2 files index, script that i gave you and DONT add more files.
please share with me the complete script.js and index.html just the one that change according to the rules in attach documents: "share code rule 5" and "share code rule 5.1" for this project and follow them STRICTLY.

Function/Method Overriding: Replacing an existing function with a new implementation
Monkey Patching: Dynamically modifying existing objects or classes at runtime
Runtime Method Swizzling: Similar concept, sometimes used in iOS/Swift development
JavaScript Method Hijacking: Another term for intercepting and replacing methods


please share with me the complete script.js attach according to the next rules:
Code Sharing Rules
When I ask you to share a large code file with me, follow these exact rules:
1. Create a NEW artifact for each section: DO NOT update/edit the same artifact when reaching character limits.
2. For the first section:
   * Create an artifact with the initial part of the code
   * Label it as "PART 1" in a comment at the top
   * Indicate the line range (e.g., "// Lines 1-150")
3. For all subsequent sections:
   * Create a COMPLETELY NEW artifact (with a new ID)
   * Include the last 5 lines from the previous section at the beginning
   * Label it clearly as "PART 2", "PART 3", etc.
   * Include line numbers as comments for reference
4. Never edit existing artifacts: When continuing code that exceeded the character limit, ALWAYS create a new artifact rather than editing the previous one.
5. Keep logical blocks intact: Don't break functions or logical blocks across different artifacts unless absolutely necessary.
6. Wait for confirmation: After sharing each part, wait for my confirmation before continuing to the next part.
This way, I will have separate, distinct code blocks that I can easily copy and reassemble without confusion.
Please confirm your understanding before sharing any code.



# Code Sharing Rules

When sharing large code files, Claude should follow these precise rules:

## Primary Rule: Maximize Each Artifact

1. **Fill each artifact to its capacity limit**: Do not create multiple small artifacts. Continue adding code to the current artifact until you reach the character limit.

2. **Only create a new artifact when absolutely necessary**: A new artifact should only be created when the character limit is reached, not based on arbitrary line counts or logical sections.

## When Creating Artifacts

3. **For the first artifact**:
   * Create an artifact with as much code as possible until reaching the character limit
   * Label it as "PART 1" in a comment at the top
   * Include the line range (e.g., "// Lines 1-750")

4. **For subsequent artifacts (only if needed due to character limits)**:
   * Create a new artifact with a new ID
   * Include the last 5-10 lines from the previous section at the beginning for continuity
   * Label it clearly as "PART 2", "PART 3", etc.
   * Include the line range (e.g., "// Lines 751-1500")

5. **Keep complete context**: When breaking mid-function or mid-block, ensure the overlapping lines provide sufficient context.

## Additional Guidelines

6. **Wait for confirmation**: After sharing each part, wait for my confirmation before continuing to the next part.

7. **Confirm understanding**: Before starting to share code, explicitly acknowledge that you understand these rules, with specific attention to using maximum capacity per artifact.

8. **Progress updates**: For very large files, provide an estimate of how many total parts will be needed based on the file size.

9. **Completion notification**: When sharing the final part, clearly indicate that it's the complete file (e.g., "This concludes the complete file").

By following these rules, we'll minimize the number of artifacts and make reassembly straightforward.
